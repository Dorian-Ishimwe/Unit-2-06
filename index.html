      so I will start with something simple like, Hello my name is Dorian.
      Recently there has been this very cool comic I read called tokyo revengers
      which follows a 25 year old man named takemichi hanagaki and his quest to
      save Hinata Tachibana, his ex-girlfriend, by changing the future through the past. He does this by leaping 12 years through time with the help of Hinata's younger
      brother, Naoto Tachibana.
